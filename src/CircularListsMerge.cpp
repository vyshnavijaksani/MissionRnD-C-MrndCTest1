/*
Given two SORTED Circular Linked Lists ,
Write a function to merge those two linked lists .
The First Linked List head should point to the final merged linked list .
The Final merged linked list should also be in SORTED order and a Circular Linked List.
You need to return the Length of Final SLL.

*********
The First linked list head should now point to the Final sorted(Ascending) Linked list First Node
*********
Ex : A: 0->3->5->10->20 (and 20 now pointing back to 0,instead of Null )
B: 1->2->6->11->21->50->70 (70 Pointing back to 1).

The Final Linked List is A:0->1->2->3->5->6->10->11->20->21->50->70 .

Note : Dont use Malloc or create any new nodes ,Only pointers need to be interchanged,
You can use temp pointers although.
Note : The Final Linked List should be  also be a circular Linked List where Last node is
pointing towards the first node.
Note : Return -1 for Invalid Inputs like NULL;

Input : head1 and head2 are Addresses of Two Circular Linked Lists heads .
Output :Return Length of New SLL .Modify the head1 value, such that it now points to 
Merged Sorted Circular SLL .

Difficulty : Medium
